To implement the assignment requirements, hereâ€™s a breakdown of the tasks and a high-level approach:

Here is a Node.js implementation of your requirements using relevant libraries.

Setup and Tools
Scraping: Use axios and cheerio for fetching and parsing Hacker News.
WebSocket: Use ws to manage real-time updates.
MySQL: Use mysql2 or sequelize for database integration.
Scheduling: Use node-cron for periodic scraping.

1. Install Required Libraries

npm install axios cheerio ws mysql2 node-cron express



Explanation
Scraping Hacker News:

Extracts stories with IDs, titles, and URLs using cheerio.
Periodically scrapes data every 5 minutes using node-cron.
WebSocket Streaming:

Sends recent stories (last 5 minutes) to new clients on connection.
Broadcasts updates when new stories are added.
MySQL Integration:

Creates a stories table if not already present.
Saves scraped stories with unique IDs (avoids duplicates with INSERT IGNORE).
Server:

Combines Express and WebSocket functionality.



How to Run
Start the MySQL database and create a database named hackernews.
Update dbConfig with your MySQL credentials.
Run the server:
            > node server.js

Connect a WebSocket client to ws://localhost:8080.
After 5 minutes, you should see real-time updates for new stories


Output
Clients receive:
Scraping: Every 5 minutes, new stories are scraped and stored in MySQL.
Real-Time Updates: Each connected WebSocket client receives updates (new stories) in real-time.
Recent Stories on Connect: When a client first connects, it gets stories from the last 5 minutes.
